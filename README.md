                                           4.11-4.15 Java Programming
 
 
4.11- If a Java program attempts to divide one integer by an other then it results in integer division which causes any fractional portion of the calculation to be truncated. This outcome could be avoided by using the unary cast operator(double) to control the variable.
 
4.12- Control statements can be stacked to one another by connecting the exit point of one statement to the entry point of the next statement. Another way would be if you placed one control statement inside of another control statement.
 
4.13- The proper repetition for calculating the sum of 100 positive integers would be Counter-controlled repetition. The reason is because the number of repetitions would be known in advance. Sentinel controlled repetition would be appropriate for the calculating the sum of an arbitrary number of positive integers. This would work because the program could use a WHILE repetition statement that totals positive integers from the user until the user decides to enter the sentinel value.
 
4.14- Postincrementing a variable is when the value before incrementing while preincrementing is when the value is taken after incrementing.
 
4.15 a) The closing double quote of the second System.out,println should be inside the closing parenthesis and there semicolon should be removed at the end of the if condition.
 
b) The variable (total) should be initialized to zero.
 
c) The two statements should be enclosed in curly braces to properly group them into the body of the (while). If this isnâ€™t done then the loop would be infinite.
